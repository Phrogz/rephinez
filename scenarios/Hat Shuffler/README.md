This scenario takes a sports league of players and places them on different
teams each round, with the goals of ensuring that:

1. Players get to play with as many different people as possible.
2. Teams are as "fair" as possible within a round (with many different criteria
   attempting to judge "fairness").
   * _Information about each player's abilities, height, age, and experience are
     used when evaluating a team._
3. When pairs of players request to play on the same team ("baggage") that
   request is honored.

# Initial Setup
The scenario can either generate a starting schedule from scratch, or injest a
previously-saved schedule to use as the starting point.

When generating a new schedule, it splits the players into men and women, sorts
them by the `Player.prototype.ranking()` function, and then distributes them
across the specified number of teams. These initial teams are duplicated across
all rounds.

# Variations
At each step the scenario picks a random round, picks two teams at random,
randomly decides if it's going to swap men or women, and then swaps two players
of the same gender between those two teams.

When the first player selected has baggage:

* If the other player has baggage of the same gender as the first player's
  baggage, swap the baggage along with the players.
* If the other player does not have baggage, find someone on their team with the
  same gender as the first player's baggage, and swap them along with them.
* If both players have baggage, but of different genders, then give up and don't
  make any change this round.

All this dancing around gender is intended to maintain the gender ratios per
team. The logic can be greatly simplified if gender ratios were not required.


# Yardsticks

* **Distributed Women** – measures how many women each team has and returns the
  standard deviation of them. This yardstick is not used, since the initial
  season generation distributes the genders evenly and the variation algorithm
  ensures that this distribution is maintained.

* **Distributed Giants** — measures the standard deviation of players over 6
  feet on each team.

* **Distributed Speed** — measures the standard deviation of players who
  self-ranked themselves as having good athleticism across the teams.

* **Distributed XP** — measures the standard deviation of players who started
  playing Ultimate before 2010.

* **Fair Teams** — a messy yardstick, this should probably be split into
  multiple yardsticks. It currently tries to balance two measurements: the
  average player vector per team, and the average team vector that each player
  got to play on.

  The goal of the first may be obvious: ensuring that in each round all teams
  have roughly the same skill.

  The goal of the second is to ensure that when the average vector for a team
  isn't consistent—when the first measurement can't be zero due to other
  constraints—that no player is consistently placed on teams that are below
  average.

  Player vectors are calculated using a formula, **not an imported value**.
  Based on how incorrect this formula can be, this likely should be changed to
  allow humans to pre-rank players.

* **Player Exposure** — attempts to ensure that everyone gets to play with
  everyone else. Measures how many people each person missed (didn't get to play
  with), and then balances the average of these values (to ensure most people
  see most people) with the maximium of these values (to help ensure no one
  person gets really left out) with the standard deviation of these values (to
  help ensure that everyone misses out on the same number of people).

* **Distributed Scheduling** — measures the standard deviation of players across
  teams, to help ensure that no one person gets stuck on the same team (and
  hence the same schedule time slot) all the time.
